# Reading notes from the book "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World" by Cal Newport

Cal says that Deep Work is focus without distraction for a long period of time on a cognitively demanding task.

He argues that Deep Work is an increasingly valuable skill in today's economy, but at the same time is increasingly rare. We are becoming more distracted than ever. Deep Work is a skill that can be cultivated through intense focus. It's like a super power once you have it. Deep Work allows you to learn complicated things more quickly, solve complex problems, and have creative ideas.

We still have to do shallow work (emails, company chat, meetings) because it keeps us from getting fired, but shallow work does not get us promoted. Shallow work is typically reactive. Deep Work is where we can truly add value and differentiate ourselves from any capable college grad or shell script.

## Key ideas

* **Drain the shallows** - eliminate sources of shallow work where possible
* **Embrace boredom** - if we constantly dilute our focus throughout the day with multitasking, social media, and TV then we will have real difficulty when it comes time to concentrate - our mind will be pulling us away towards new and exciting stimuli that are quick hits vs the sustained focus required for Deep Work
* **Attention residue** - splitting attention has negative effects (even when doing things serially) when we switch out of a focus mode to something else (email, chat, etc) and come back, our attention will still be partially on that other thing - we will only have partial attention when we return and less effective
* **Myelin workout** - performing deep work creates high speed networks in our brains to connect the information
* **high quality work equation** - time invested x intensity of focus, intense focus over extended periods of time leads to extradorinary results
* **routines** - structure your life with routines and rituals that help you do Deep Work - time blocks are the power tool of time management - it's an intentional craftsmanship lifestyle - there are 4 approaches Cal describes
  * monastic - secluded lifestyle
  * rythemic - regular long intervals (day(s)) of deep work each week
  * bi-modal - mix of monastic and rythemic - maybe weeks of Deep Work each year
  * journalistic - schedule time blocks week-by-week depending on what's happening
* **wildly important goal** - instead of focusing on eliminating distraction and shallow work - focus on a wildly important goal so that you can replace those shallow things with deep things - it's motivating instead of getting frustrated with shallow work
  * The 4 Disciplines of Excution (referenced in Deep Work):
    1. focus on a wildly important goal
    2. leverage leading measures
    3. keep a compelling scoreboard
    4. create a cadance of accountability  
* **shutdown complete** - develop a habit and ritual of ending the day - set limits - close out the day so your mind can rest and recover in the evening - Cal literally says to himself "shutdown complete" - it's like interval training - give your mind time to rest after intense focus - Brian Johnson talks about how olympic sprinters notoriously sleep a lot - they are recovering in between workouts/races
* **tool selection** - avoid the "any value" mindset when selecting tools - nearly all tools have _some value, otherwise they would be useful - instead, you have to evaluate if the tool provides substantial value to you that it outweighs the costs/negatives
* deep work equation: `time invested * intensity of focus = quality of work`

* Brian Johnson's [summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_2a_jsGYw) of Deep Work is really good
