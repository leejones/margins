# Reading Notes from Procrastinate on Purpose

The one thing: invest in significance

Summary: In order to move away from the latest and loudest (priority dillution) to the truly signifant (priority concentrate), we have to give ourselves the permission to invest in things today that will give you more time tomorrow.

## Priority Dillution

The important/urgent matrix.

Many people are busy focused on important work that is urgent, but they fail to focus on the important work that is not urgent. Being focused on urgent important work causes priority dillution because it's always latest and loudest. It's typically other people's priorities.

## Time Management

We cannot manage time. We can only manage ourselves.

The classic time management techniques are important and valuable, but they have some limitations:

1. **efficiency** - getting more done in less time is good, but more work will appear to fill the time
2. **prioritization** - moves one task above another, but does not create time

We need a model for focusing our time and investing it in way that multiplies it over the long term. It's like compounding interest applied to time.

## Significance

Traditional time management focuses on 2 things: urgency and importance. Roy adds a 3rd component to the equation: significance.

1. **urgency**: how **soon** something matters
2. **importance**: how **much** something matters
3. **significance**: how **long** something matters

## Focus Funnel

To counteract priority dillution, Roy suggests running tasks through a series of tests:

1. **eliminate** - Can I get rid of this? This is the permission to **ignore**.
2. **automate** - Can I create a system or process to handle this? This is the permission to **invest**.
3. **delegate** - Can someone else do this? The permission to be **imperfect**.
4. At this point you are the only person that can do this. The question is, does it need to be done now?
  1. yes: **concentrate** - The permission to **focus**.
  2. no: **procrastinate** - The permission to be **incomplete** or **wait**.

## Delegate

If you delegate, accept that it may not be done exactly as well as you would have. It may not be done as fast as you could have. It may not be done when you would have. However, once the person learns it and owns, they may well exceed what you could have done.

The key is to invest the time. Roy says to expect to invest time up front and/or along the way in helping the person learn how to do something, but over the long term it will pay off.

Expect to invest about 30x the amount of time teaching someone to perform a task. For example, if you have a task that takes you 5 minutes, then expect to invest 150 minutes teaching someone else how to do it (not necessarily all at once though).

When you delegate, it's not going to be perfect. It's not going to be as good as you would do it... AT FIRST. Eventually the person will own and master the task in a way that is most likely going to be better. Be ok with it not be perfect at first. Delegation is a long term investment.
