My notes from reading [2 Second Lean](http://2secondlean.com).

I listened to the audiobook version and enjoyed the parts where Paul went off script. It's incredible that Paul wrote this book and gave it away for free as a gift back to the lean community.

1. overproduction
2. transportation
3. inventory
4. defects
5. overprocessing
6. excess motion
7. waiting
8. unutilized talent
