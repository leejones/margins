## Speech

It _connects_ us or _separates_ us.

Be aware of our intent when speaking. Do we intend to connect with others? or create separation?

## Lying

Lying is a form of speech that separates us from others (and ourselves).

Speaking truthfully allows us to grow our ability to be mindful because we are better connected to ourselves and others.

## Avoid

Avoid the following types of speech:

1. lying
2. malicious
3. gossip
4. harsh (not courteous)

The further you get into that list the harder it is to avoid (ex. 4 is the hardest).

## Prefer

Kind speech.

Speech that is:

* true
* kind
* useful
* connective

Speech that is born out of genuine concern or gratitude.

## Ripples

Mindfulness is about what we are becoming now and in the future.

The little changes we make today will build (or detract) in larger ways to the future.

For example, a small course change for a ship (1/2 degree) will not seem like much over the next few hours, but will be a great difference over a few days or weeks.
