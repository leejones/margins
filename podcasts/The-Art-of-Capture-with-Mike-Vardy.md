##  Capturing

Get things out of your head so that there is room for focusing on the task at hand.

Capture:

* thoughts and ideas as they come
* the life you want (this is what it's really about)

Capturing as a loading dock, not a warehouse. Treat it like an inbox and process it regularly.

Process weekly at the lease (weekly review), but consider making a daily habit of processing captured items.

The more you capture, the better you get at curation.

## Bullet Journal

Discussed the [Bullet Journal](http://www.bulletjournal.com) system. The system is paper-based and for each day there are three main types of items (bullets):

* tasks - signified by a box
* events - signified by a circle
* notes - signified with a dot

Events get logged daily and then are transferred to a page for that month.

The system uses page numbers throughout the journal and an index at the front to make things easy to find.

## Time and Space

Mentioned a Ted Talk by John Cleese about how creativity requires two things:

* time
* space

I tried to find the video, but it looks like its been removed.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAwDWe7OIF8) seems to be similar.

## Qualities of a good capturing (or planning) system

* simple
* obvious
* scalable

Ideally it has all of these qualities. Sometimes a system with two out of three will work. For example, a system that is simple and scalable, but not obvious can be learned over time.
