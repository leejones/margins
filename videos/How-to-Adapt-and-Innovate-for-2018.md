## keys to adapting to (surviving) disruptions in technology and remaining relevant

1) customer empthy
2) keeping an eye on the future and what it means for the customer

### customer empathy

In order to innovate, the technologists need to fundamentally understand the problem of the customer. That empathy should not (cannot) be mediated through a product manger.

If you don't (continually) understand your customer and the context in which they use your product, you will not innovate.

You need to observe the customer and how they use the product. Don't just listen to what they tell you that they need. Their perspective does not understand the broad range of capabilities and solutions you can provide. Observe them actually using the product and come up with better ways to help them.

### eye on the future (and what it means for the customer)

Keep an eye on what is emerging to figure out how to better solve the age-old problems for your customer.

## conclusion

Take responsibility for continually developing customer empathy in the organization and keeping an eye on what the future of technology provides to better solve the needs of customers.
