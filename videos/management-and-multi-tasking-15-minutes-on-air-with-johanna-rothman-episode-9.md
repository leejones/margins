There is no way to "get it all done". You have to make choices.

On management:

> Create a system of work... for people to get work done... instead of telling people what to do.

Create a system of management (an environment) for people to work effectively instead of telling them what to do.

Believe that people want to do a great job.

A key role for a manager is to do strategic thinking.

Focus on breaking work into small, deliverable chunks.

In reference to response to how Johanna get so much done she said that the book [Personal Kanban](http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B004R1Q642) works well for her. In reference to how she is able to write so many different things (blog posts, books, articles, talks, etc), she mentioned the [Fieldstone Method](http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B004JU0TZS) of writing.
