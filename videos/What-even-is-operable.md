* Innovators focus on principles.
* Imitators focus on practices. (sometimes you have to fake it till you make it)
* People who don't get it focus on tools.

Some of the most effective changes in a complex (organizational) system are often to focus on reducing friction.

Operable is closely related to usable. Think LXC vs Docker. LXC is fully featured by not operable. Docker has limited features but is highly operable. Which would you rather have? (hint: it depends on the context)

Context matters. A formula one car is appropriate in a high speed race, but terrible in a demolition derby. Make sure to understand your context.

An organization (and DevOps) is a [sociotechnical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system). The people and technology both matter. The technology is not necessarily material. It can also be the systems and processes.
