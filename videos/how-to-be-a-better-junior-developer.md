A nice formula when asking for help:

> I'm trying to ____, so that I can _____.
> I'm running into _____.
> I've looked at _____ and tried _____.

## As a mentor

Validate what the mentee might be feeling:

> Sometimes things are confusing not because you're new, but because they are confusing.

Ask about what the mentee's learning style might be. See what feedback the mentee might have on your teaching style.

Let the mentee know when it is ok to interupt you during the day so that they won't feel bad about asking questions.

If your philosophy as a mentor is to let the mentee struggle through something as part of learning, it's really good to let them know. Let them know when something is hard so they don't feel bad about having difficulty.

There is so much for a mentee to learn. Help them narrow the scope and pick a small piece to learn next.

## As a mentee

You can contribute to the team. You can ask questions, especially about assumptions. Sometimes a mentee's perspective can help solve a problem.

Speak up when there are good things that happen. Give positive feedback.
