> Charles Kettering, the famed inventor and head of research for GM, said “a problem well-stated is half-solved.”

This seems to ring true. The more you I understand a problem, the closer it seems I am to the solution. The reverse is also true.

Some tips from the post about making the problem clearer:

> State the problem in a sentence.

If it takes more than that, you may not understand the problem well enough.

> Make the problem statement into a question.

By framing it as a question, it makes it easier to understand what we are seeking.

> Restate the question in five ways.

By rethinking the question, we open our mind to other possibilities and perspectives on the problem.

> Give yourself thinking quotas. 

Generate an arbitrary number of ideas to help draw out more thought on the problem.

> Knock your questions.

Question everything. Reject the premise of questions. Ask, "What would also need to be true for this question to make sense?"
