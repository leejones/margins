There is a time for coaching and a time for teaching based on the cost of failure and the person's ability and willingness to learn.

* coaching: the person is very ready to learn and the cost of failure is low
* teaching: the person is ready enough to learn, but the cost of failure is high

Coaching is _pulling_ ideas from the person. Teaching is _pushing_ ideas to the person.

Assess the person's current state and the cost of failure before choosing an approach.
