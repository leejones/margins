Be careful when removing blame from the individual that it is not simply shifted elsewhere. The "system" is made of people. "Management" and "Leadership" are made of people. If we shift blame to those vague entities, we foster an "us" vs "them" mentality. We may reduce the chance for improvement in ourselves and the "systems" we are raging against.

Key points:

> Emphasize that organizational leaders are well intentioned

We are all on the same team. We need to help connect front-line workers and leadership so both are aware of the challanges.

> Acknowledge shared systemic constraints

The front-line workers have contraints (time, money, competing objectives, deadlines, bosses) and the leadership has similar constraints (time, money, competing objectives, deadlines, bosses). Both need to be understanding and work to mitigate the effects of those constraints (maybe even leverage the constraint).

> Highlight that a systems approach is not binary

It's not fronline vs leadership or human vs system. The system is complex. A systemic perspective that considers the interdependences is required.

> Give credit to collective accountability

Isolated fixes have limited value to the whole. The components of the system must be aligned in the problem solving effort for it to be effective.
