## Major themes

This post is about social justice work, but has broad application.

The idea is that some work is all consuming, much like a marathon. A runner does not run marathon after marathon. When they train, they work in intervals.

Run for x miles, recover for x days. Incremental increase the mileage.

Adjust to how your body is handling the training (same for work).

The rest periods are for recovery, not for collapsing from pushing to0 hard.

Do some self-reflection and improvement during the recovery times.
