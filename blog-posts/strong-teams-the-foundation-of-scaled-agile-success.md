## Major themes

> Here are some specific indicators of Delivery Team maturity:
>
> 1. Measures of velocity, throughput, and/or cycle time...
> 2. Short cycle times with high fidelity feedback...
> 3. Consistently high acceptance rates...
> 4. Thorough Definition of Done...
> 5. Comprehensive test strategy and continuous delivery...
> 6. Measured and managed technical-debt...
> 7. A well-groomed backlog...
> 8. Continuous planning at all 5 levels...

Interesting section on technical debt:

> High levels of technical debt are often related to a weak D of D, or it may simply be the fruit of sins past. Technical-debt increases variability and risk. Technical debt includes untested code, code lacking automated test coverage, unmerged code, unintegrated system components, design flaws, and code smells that require refactoring. The lack of enabling infrastructure can also be considered a form of debt or underinvestment.

The section about backlog is also interesting:

> We generally advise teams and Product Owners to maintain 1.5 to 2.5 iterations of “ready” stories in the backlog (maybe more going into release planning). Well-groomed and ready means more than story cards with estimates. It means ready to code- acceptance criteria everyone on the team really understands, and a viable high-level design approach everyone has an informed consensus on.
