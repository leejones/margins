## Notes from reading the "Conway's Law" paper

The [paper](http://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html) can be found a Mel Conway's website.

Conway's Law is often used in the context of software, but applies to any system (ex. government, communities, transportation).

The system is made in the image of its creator.

There is a strong correlation between the communication structures of the group(s) that designs a system and the design of the system itself.

**During design of a system we often think there is not enough time to "get it right", but infinite time to fix it later.**

The larger the organization, the more profound the effect of Conway's Law.

The classic pattern:

1. a system is "needed"
2. designer begins work
3. designer realizes system will be large
4. designer feels pressure of deadline
5. designer delegates pieces of the design
6. design becomes fragmented
7. manager feels pressure of deadline
8. manager assigns more resources

More designers does not necessarily produce a better design.

As communication breaks down between designers, the design also breaks down.

> organizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations
